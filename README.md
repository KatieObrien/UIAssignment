For this program I decided to do a stationary viewing port used by the caption of a ship to be able to see and get information
about objects/stars around the ship.

In this program you can:
Move your view to the left and to the right to see more of whats around you.
When you move the mouse over a star you get the information about that specific star pop up in the middle of the screen.
The time is in the top left hand corner.
The x annd y co ordinates of the mouse are in the bottom left hand corner.
The fuel gauge is in the right top hand corner and when this runs out the program shuts down.

There is a small glitch in the program as I tried to get the mouse rollover function to work but it would mess up my other functions
like the flashing background stars and such so I had to scrap it. The glitch is when the ship changes view and you put your mouse
over the co ordinates or a stars original x and y co ordinates the information for that star will pop up.
